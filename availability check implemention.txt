Add-on requirements (copy/paste)

Copy-only-available feature

Add a button: “Copy Available Domains” that copies ONLY the bare domains (no price, no status, no bullets), one per line.

Example copied text:

trustagent.com
trustscope.ai
trustsignal.io

Rules:

Copy list must include only domains that are verified available=true (or “Not verified” must be excluded).

Preserve current on-screen sort order (top to bottom).

Show toast: “Copied X domains”.


Also add a small “Copy” icon per row that copies just that single domain string (e.g., trustagent.com).

Increase limits to 4000

Change defaults and caps:

maxChecks default 4000

UI slider/input range up to 4000

Generator can continue checking until it hits the Target Available Results or hits 4000 checks (whichever first).


Performance safeguards required:

Concurrency limit still required (start at 3–5). Add adaptive backoff if provider rate-limits (HTTP 429), e.g. reduce concurrency and retry with delay.

Add progress indicator: “Checked 1320/4000 — Found 67 available”.

Add a “Stop” button to cancel ongoing checks cleanly.


IMPORTANT: Even with 4000 checks, do not freeze the UI—use async queue + batching.





You are working on my domain generator web app (static site deployed on Netlify, repo on GitHub). I want a direct availability + price checker that only shows available domains, highlights them green, and filters out premium.

Goal

When I click “Generate Results”, the app should:

1. Generate candidate names internally (same logic as now)


2. Check real availability for each candidate in real time


3. Show ONLY domains that are available, each in a green box


4. Display price (registration price) when available


5. Exclude premium results (premium, “for sale”, aftermarket)


6. Restrict TLDs to only: .com, .ai, .io 

7. Stop after finding N available domains (e.g., 50), instead of generating 2000 visible results


8. Support “CSV export” but export only the available domains with price + registrar link



UI requirements

Add settings:

“Target available results”: default 50 (user can set 10–200)

“Max checks”: default 500 (hard safety limit so it doesn’t run forever)

Toggle: “Show checking progress” (e.g., “Checked 120/500 — Found 18 available”)


Results list: each item shows:

domain (example.com)

TLD badge (.com/.ai/.io)

availability status (Available ✅)

price (e.g. $10.98) if returned

registrar (e.g. Namecheap)

a “Buy” button/link to registrar search for that domain



Architecture requirements (Netlify Functions)

This cannot be done reliably only in browser; implement via a Netlify Function:

Create: /netlify/functions/check-domain.js

Frontend calls it with JSON: { "domain": "example.com" }

Function returns JSON:


{
  "domain": "example.com",
  "available": true,
  "price": 10.98,
  "currency": "USD",
  "premium": false,
  "registrar": "Namecheap",
  "buyUrl": "https://...."
}

Provider choice

I don’t know API keys. Implement it in a way that works for me:

Preferred approach (real availability + price + premium flag):

Use a provider that returns availability + price + premium.

If a paid API key is required, implement:

A “provider = mock/demo” mode that works with a placeholder key and returns “unknown” rather than breaking the site.

A clear step-by-step “How to add API key on Netlify” guide inside a SETUP.md.



Fallback approach (no API key):

If we can’t use a real domain availability API without a key, still implement:

“Buy link only” mode that does not claim availability, but sends user to registrar search.

UI must label results as “Not verified” in that mode.


But if possible, still do the real approach as default.


Filtering premium

If provider returns premium=true, hide it.

If provider doesn’t return premium:

Treat any result with price > $100 (configurable threshold) as premium and hide.

Also hide if response indicates “aftermarket”, “auction”, “for sale”, etc.



Performance requirements

Don’t hit rate limits:

Use concurrency limit: 3–5 checks at a time (configurable)

Debounce/cancel: if user clicks Generate again, cancel in-flight requests

Cache results in memory + localStorage for 24h (domain → availability/price)


The generator should stop early once it finds the target number of available domains.


Code changes to existing files

Update generator flow: generate candidates -> queue checks -> render only available

Add status bar showing checks/found

Add green card CSS style for available

Update CSV export to only available results with price

Update TLD selector to only .com .ai .io and remove others


Netlify config

I currently have netlify.toml. Ensure:

functions directory is netlify/functions

add redirect so /api/check maps to the function if needed:

/api/check -> /.netlify/functions/check-domain


Don’t break my existing SPA redirect to /SuperCombinator.html


Deliverables

1. Working implementation


2. SETUP.md that explains:

What an API key is

Which provider you chose

Where to paste the key in Netlify UI

How to test locally and on production



3. If the provider requires payment, include a free alternative mode (buy-link only).



IMPORTANT: Do not fake availability. If availability cannot be verified without a key, show “Not verified” and only provide buy links.
